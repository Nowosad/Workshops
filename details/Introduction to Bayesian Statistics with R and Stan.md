## Introduction to Bayesian Statistics with R and Stan - Rasmus Bååth (Lund University)
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

This tutorial is a general introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis, a powerful technique for fitting almost any model to data. It is especially useful when one wants to build models that include information both from data and from domain specific knowledge. Some situations that are easily handled by Bayesian methods are multiple comparisons, optional stopping, and non-Normal data distributions. A Bayesian analysis also go hand in hand with decision analysis, that is, taking a statistical result and calculating the optimal decision given some utility function (say, monetary gain).

The goal of the tutorial is for you to get an understanding of what Bayesian statistics is and why it is useful. After the tutorial you will have a theoretical understanding about how Bayesian methods work and should be able to run simple Bayesian analyses using the STAN library, an open source framework for Bayesian computation which can be used together with, for example, Python and R.
 
**Plan of the workshop**

The tutorial is divided into two parts where each part consists of a presentation followed by a hands-on exercise session. Part 1 will introduce Bayesian modeling from a simulation based perspective and describe the What? Why? and How? of Bayesian data analysis. The following exercise session will have you implementing a simple Bayesian model from scratch and fitting this model using base R. Part 2 will focus on R packages that facilitates specifying and fitting Bayesian models. The following exercise session will show you how to fit more complex models using the rstan package.
 
**Required packages**

rstan
 
**Required skills of participants**

The tutorial is very much introductory in that no prior knowledge of Bayesian data analysis, or even likelihood based statistics, is assumed. For the hands-on exercises it will be necessary for you to know your way around R and to be comfortable manipulating vectors and data frames.

**Required work to do before workshop**

The rstan package. Make sure you can run the following test script: https://gist.github.com/rasmusab/744410db9cf85ecb85e1
 
**Research experience**

I’m Rasmus Bååth, researcher at Lund University Cognitive Science, Sweden, where I use Bayesian data analysis in my research.

**Experience as lecturer/teacher**

I've held several introductory tutorials to Bayesian data analysis, for example at the last UseR! meeting in Aalborg. At UseR! 2014 I presented the R package Bayesian First Aid (http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/abstracts/talks/32_Baath.pdf) that aims at making it really easy to get started with Bayesian Data analysis in R. I blog about Bayesian statistics and R at http://www.sumsar.net.
