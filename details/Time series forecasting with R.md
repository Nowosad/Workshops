## Time series forecasting with R - Adam Zagdański (1) Faculty of Pure And Applied Mathematics, Wroclaw University of Technology 2) QuantUp)
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

The main goal of the workshop is to provide participants with basic R-tools that can be used to forecast time series. This includes necessary data preparation, using appropriate forecasting methods and assessing the forecast accuracy. During the workshop both simple (naive) forecasting algorithms as well as some advanced methods will be introduced. Due to time limitation, we will concentrate mostly on automatic procedures used to find the best model for a given time series. Participants will have an opportunity to practice and apply their learning using real time series data from different areas.

**Plan of the workshop**

* How to represent and visualize time series in R?
* Some simple (naive) forecasting methods
* Measuring forecast accuracy
* Selected advanced forecasting methods
  - forecasting based on trend and seasonality decomposition
  - exponential smoothing
  - ARIMA
* Using automatic procedures to find the best model
* Real time series data examples: Comparison of forecasting accuracy and choosing the best model
 
**Required packages**

forecast, TSAFBook, Mcomp, fma, expsmooth, fpp, lattice, mvtsplot
 
**Required skills of participants**

- Elementary-level knowledge of R language is required, including: command syntax, basic data import/export operations, knowledge of data/object types, graphical display, usage of R packages and built-in functions and using R for basic data analysis operations.
- At least basic familiarity with R-Studio environment is required.
- No prior knowledge on time series is required.
 
**Required work to do before workshop**

* Installing R & R-Studio
* Installing the following packages and their dependencies:
  - forecast
  - TSAFBook
  - Mcomp
  - fma
  - expsmooth
  - fpp
  - lattice
  - mvtsplot
